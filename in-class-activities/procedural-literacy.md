# Procedural Literacy

_Concocted by Allison Berkoy, inspired by exquisite corpse and procedural drawing activities._

_Note: I've used variations of this activity for the first day of class, working well both on Zoom (using breakout rooms) and in person. I've found it to be a good ice breaker team-building activity, challenging and ridiculous, and a lot of fun._

## The set up:
  
  Intro with discussion asking: 
  * what is **code**? 
  * what is a **procedure**?
  * what is an **algorithm**?
  * what is **procedural literacy**?

Sometimes I quote from...
* “Michael Mateas, an associate professor in the computer science program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, describes procedural literacy as ’the ability to read and write processes, to engage procedural representation and aesthetics.’ One component of procedural literacy is the idea that **programming is not strictly a technical task; it’s an act of communication and a symbolic way of representing the world.**” - Casey Reas, [Form and Code](https://formandcode.com/).

Is anyone familiar with the surrealist game [Exquisite Corpse](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse)?
* Explain / show examples. 

## Loose instructions:

Students need 1 piece of paper and something to draw with (can grab supplies from V-203 office ahead of time).

Split the class into two groups: group 1 and group 2.

Students: 
* Fold your paper in half. 
* When the timer begins, you will either draw a "head" within the top half of your paper or a "body" within the bottom half of your paper.
* "Head" and "Body" are up to interpretation, and may refer to the top half or bottom half of a human, animal, or other kind of creature or abstract entity....   
* Keep the drawing simple, and do not let anyone see your drawing!  

Instructor, start the timer for 5 minutes. 

Students:
* If group 1, draw a "head" on the top half of your paper.  
* If group 2, draw a "body" on the bottom half of your paper.  
  
Timer ends. Stop drawing.  

Pair up:  
*  Each pair has someone from group 1 (now named #1) and someone from group 2 (now named #2).  
* If an odd number, form a group of 3, with at least 1 person from group 1 and at least 1 person from group 2.  
* Do not show each other your drawings! 


Re-drawing the head (5-10 minute timer):
* #1 gives verbal instructions to #2 for drawing the head that has already been drawn on #1's paper.
* #2 receives verbal instructions for drawing the head and proceeds in drawing the head within the top half of their own paper.  

Re-drawing Rules:
* Keep the drawings hidden from each other throughout! No peeking! 
* No gestures are allowed. 
* Verbal instructions only. 
* The drawer may ask for an instruction to be repeated (if they did not hear it), but they cannot ask for clarification of an instruction.

Re-drawing the body (5-10 minute timer):
* #2 gives verbal instructions to #1 for drawing the body that has already been drawn on #2's paper.
* #1 receives verbal instructions for drawing the body and proceeds in drawing the body within the bottom half of their own paper.
* Same rules as above. No peeking, no gestures, no clarification of instructions other than repeating the instruction.

The Grand Reveal:
* #1 and #2 reveal the complete drawings to each other.  
* When unfolding their papers, they should have a "matching" head and body, half originally drawn, half interpreted.
* Place the papers side by side.  
* The class views the results of each pair.

Reflection:
* Review the drawings:  how similar, dissimilar?
* How was your experience in giving instructions?
* How was your experience in drawing? How clear were the instructions?  
* What might you take away from this exercise when considering writing code, procedures, algorithms?
