## Due Wednesday, 10/30  
  
### **Midterm 2nd Iteration**    
Taking class feedback into account, submit a second iteration of your midterm project. Double check the [midterm project](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Berkoy-MTEC1201-Fall2024/wiki/Midterm-Project) requirements to make sure that your midterm is meeting all requirements. In this second iteration, pay particular attention now to user experience and tweaking as needed. Fork your midterm sketch (leaving the original version intact) and save the second iteration with file name "Midterm-V2-[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "Midterm-V2-AllisonB"). Submit to our OpenProcessing class site "Midterm V2" collection.

There is no additional short study assignment for this week.
