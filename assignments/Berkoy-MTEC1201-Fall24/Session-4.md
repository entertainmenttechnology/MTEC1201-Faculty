## Due Wednesday, 9/25  

### **Familiarize Yourself with the following...**            
   
p5.js variables:      
* [mouseIsPressed](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mouseIsPressed) (note the difference with [mousePressed()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mousePressed/) event function)   
* [keyIsPressed](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/keyIsPressed) (note the difference with [keyPressed()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/keyPressed/) event function)  
* [key](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/key)   
* Optionally explore more key and mouse variables in the p5.js reference under "mouse" and "keyboard"     

  
Operators:  
* Relational: > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)  
* Equality: === (strictly equal to), !== (strictly not equal to)    
* Binary logical: && (and), || (or)  
 
p5.js functions:    
* Event listener functions: [mousePressed()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mousePressed) and [keyPressed()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyPressed) (use a separate code block for these)        
* Optionally explore more key and mouse event functions in the p5.js reference under "mouse" and "keyboard"  
* [random()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/random)

### **Short Study #3: Creating Uncertainty**    
Create a responsive drawing using p5.js involving user input, conditional statements, and randomness, inspired by the theme you have chosen for this series of sketches. You may use the previous assignment as a starting point, or begin a completely new sketch. 

The drawing must react to the mouse and/or keyboard in some way and must include the following:  
* Use of declared variables (named by you)    
* At least one conditional statement using if, else if, AND else 
* Use of the random() function
* Mouse and/or keyboard input   
* A developed concept and techniques moving beyond the in-class demos 
* Include as a comment at the top of your sketch: your name, title, any instructions for the user, and a brief description of the theme you are exploring in your sketch     
  
To particularly consider: how might the strategic use of conditional statements and the random() function create a more unpredictable and engaging user experience?    
  
Note: when using the random() function, avoid triggering the function continuously within draw(), which will create a strobing effect. Instead, use it within a conditional statement or event function as a momentary trigger. Sketches containing strobing visuals or rapid flashing cannot be accepted, as it can make others sick when viewing your work.  
  
Save the completed sketch as "SS3_[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "SS3_AllisonB"). Submit to our OpenProcessing Class Site "SS3" collection **before the beginning of class on 9/25**.
