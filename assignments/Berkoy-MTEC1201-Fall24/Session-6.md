## Due Wednesday, 10/16  


### **Familiarize Yourself with the following...**            
    
* creating user-defined functions      
* implementing state changes
  
_Refer to our demo examples on Open Processing and supplemental materials below._


### **Midterm Project WIP**    

Your first midterm work in progress sketch is due before class on 10/16. See the [Midterm Project](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Berkoy-MTEC1201-Fall2024/wiki/Midterm-Project) requirements for more details. There is no additional short study assignment for this week.   
  
## **Supplemental/Optional:**      
I recommend this tutorial on [organizing code with functions](https://p5js.org/tutorials/organizing-code-with-functions/) for extra practice.   

For video tutorials relating to this week's topics, check out The Coding Train:  
* [function basics](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/5-functions/1-basics)    
* [parameters and arguments](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/5-functions/2-arguments)  
* [functions and return](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/5-functions/3-return)  
  
_Note that some of the older Coding Train videos declare variables using "var." You should instead use "let" or "const" when declaring your variables._
